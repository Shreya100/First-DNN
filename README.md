### Convolutions:
Convolution is matrix muliplications over an image to get features from that image.

### Filters/Kernels
Kernel is a combination of channels which acts as a feature extractor.

### Epochs
One entire cycle of all the images being passed through the CNN network.

### 1x1 Convolution
It is a kernel that is used to increase or decrease the number of channels in the output image. It is usually used to decrease the number of channels. It doesn't alter the dimensions of the image.

### 3x3 Convolution
It is a kernel that convolves over an image and it has a local receptive field of 9pixels. It reduces the dimensions of the image by 2 pixels.

### Feature Maps
It is collection of features contained in the kernels after each layer. 

### Activation Function
An activation function is a mathematical function that is usually applied to the output of each layer of network to get a non-linear function.

### Receptive Field
It is the area(the number of pixels) that a kernel can see locally-directly(local receptive field) and indirectly (global-receptive field)
